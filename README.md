Recognise and Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST Database using kNN Algorithm

The MNIST Database contains 70,000 handwritten images of different digits. 60,000 of these images are input to the algorithm, along with their correct corresponding digit values. 
Subsequent to this, any image from the remaining 10,000 can be input as a test case. Using a conventional k Nearest Neighbours Algorithm, the model tries to identify the digit in the image. 
This prediction is compared with the acutal correct value. Also the value of k (i.e. number of nearest neighbours to be considered), can be set to an appropriate value so as to have good accuracy while also having a small execution time.
